# epics-team-builder
We will be providing the UTDesign EPICS team with a brand new user interface to run their team building algorithm which puts together the teams for each semester. Along the way, we will also attempt to add more features into the algorithm, fix bugs, and make any changes necessary. The old user interface was small, and not easy to use. We want to provide a fluid user experience in a stand alone website that opens up the possibility for anyone to run this algorithm without any issues. The UI redesign will be using React, a JavaScript library used for creating user interfaces. We believe in the wonderful component structure of react, which allows for a more structured design and easier collaboration with other developers.
